# Exercise 1: creating data frames

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahawks scored in the first 4 games
# of the season (google "Seahawks" for the scores!)
seahawks <- c(9, 12, 27, 46)

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahwaks have allowed to be scored
# against them in each of the first 4 games of the season
others <- c(17, 9, 33, 18)

# Combine your two vectors into a dataframe called `games`
games <- data.frame(seahawks, others)

# Create a new column "diff" that is the difference in points between the teams
# Hint: recall the syntax for assigning new elements (which in this case will be
# a vector) to a list!
games$diff <- abs(seahawks - others)

# Create a new column "won" which is TRUE if the Seahawks won the game
games$won <- seahawks - others > 0

# Create a vector of the opponent names corresponding to the games played
opponents <- c("Dolphins", "Rams", "49ers", "Saints")

# Assign your dataframe rownames of their opponents
rownames(games) <- opponents

# View your data frame to see how it has changed!
games
